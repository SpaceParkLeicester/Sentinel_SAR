# SAR Storage Oil Tank Datasets

### UK Oil refineries datasets
. [Refinerymaps.com](https://www.refinerymaps.com/) provides a refinery dataset but it is expensive to download
. List of oil terminals manually collected in a [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_terminals_in_the_United_Kingdom)
. An [article](https://fueloilnews.co.uk/2022/11/the-uks-refineries-past-present-and-future/) from Nov 2022 detailing past, present UK oil refineries
