* SAR Data has diffferent type of features namely statistical, geometric, textural, contextual and SAR polari-metric characteristics. Explanation regarding [Feature Extraction for SAR target classification](https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/lcs/previous/LCS2005/47.pdf)
* [Synthetic Apperture RADAR basics](https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/SciTechBook/series2/02Chap1_110106_amf.pdf), and the definition of depression angle is the "the angle between the radar beam and the horizontal at the radar platform." and [clutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter_(radar)) is a term used for unwanted echoes in electronic systems.
* Deep learning models to look out: CBD-Net, DeepLabv3, D-LinkNet, U-Net
